# My first responsive design.

## Keir Pearson and James Abustan

### Project Brief
* Create a responsive website showcasing our chosen food type / choice.
* Project should include more than one html page.
* Implement a CSS framework of our choice. 
* Restaurant page should link to restaurants of your choice. 

### Tech used 
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap


### What have we learned?
* Learned how to display and icon in the web browser tab.
* Learned how to display images at a consistent height.
* Learned how to make a sticky navbar.
* Learned how to use linear gradient on hero images.
* Learned how to use image carousels and how to embed videos from youTube.
* Working in a pair efficiently.
* We learned a lot about flexbox and how it works.

### What challenges we overcame
* Image sizing was difficult for us as we took a long time to work out how * to display images consistently.
* Had to refactor our website to separate pages due to misunderstanding the brief.
* Embedding a youTube video was harder than we anticipated.

### What we struggled with
* Often had too much padding sticking out in various places due to unfamiliarity with integrated bootstrap css.
* Took time to get used to working with bootstrap from pure css.
Getting used to a git workflow.

### What we would do differently next time
* Get more familiar with documentation of bootstrap or relevant framework.
* Implement more challenging styles and more dynamic page elements (hover styles, pills, hamburgers, collapsible menus etc)
* Take more breaks!
