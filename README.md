# My first responsive design.

## Keir Pearson and James Abustan

### What have we learned?
Learned how to display and icon in the web browser tab.
Learned how to display images at a consistent height.
Learned how to make a sticky navbar.
Learned how to use linear gradient on hero images.
Got more familiar with bootstrap.
Learned how to use image carousels and how to embed videos from youTube.
Working in a pair efficiently.
We learned a lot about flexbox and how it works.

### What challenges we overcame
Image sizing was difficult for us as we took a long time to work out how to display images consistently.
Had to refactor our website to separate pages due to misunderstanding the brief.
Exploding computer due to infinite loop in hyperlink.
Embedding a youTube video was harder than we anticipated.

### What we struggled with
Often had too much padding sticking out in various places due to unfamiliarity with integrated bootstrap css.
Took time to get used to working with bootstrap from pure css.
Getting used to a git workflow.

### What we would do differently next time
Read the brief properly.
Get more familiar with documentation of bootstrap or relevant framework.
Implement more challenging styles and more dynamic page elements (hover styles, pills, hamburgers, collapsible menus etc)
Take more breaks!
